##  Description
My solutions to the assignments that was given. The use 

## Dependencies
My solutions were written in python 3.13.7 and uses the following modules:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- os
- re
- Wordcloud

## Installing
The required modules can be installed from the attached requirements.txt file.
Before running the program please ensure the following.
- For assignments where We write to a file, please ensure that the desired destination for the document exists within the WD.

## Executing the program
The scripts for Delopgave 1 and Delopgave 4 can just be run.
Delopgave 2 has the function
```
Log_analysis(Log_file,output_dir_name)

```
Which takes the log_file and output_dir_name as strings, where it reads the log_file and outpur
t_dir_name is the name of the folder where the scripts writes to.

Delopgave 3 has the function:
```
All_together(file_name: str, Destination_name: str, Var_numbers=0, seperator=",")
```
The function takes file_name to read and Destination_name as the name of the document to write to as mandatory arguments, with Var_numbers and seperator being optional. It is recommended not to change the optional arguments as of this moment. 

## Problems
I found the aspects of delopgave 3 the most challenging since it is what is the furthest from the experience i have from my studies.
